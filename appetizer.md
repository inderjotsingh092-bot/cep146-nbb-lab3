\# Pepper Jelly and Cream Cheese Dip



\## Ingredients

* Nonstick cooking spray, for the baking dish
* 2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
* 1/4 cup mayonnaise
* 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
* 1/4 tsp. paprika
* Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)
* 1 green onion, thinly sliced
* 1 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese (about 4 ounces)
* 1 cup grated pepper jack cheese (about 4 ounces)
* 1 (10-ounce) jar pepper jelly
* Crackers or fresh vegetables, such as cucumbers, celery, carrots, and radishes, for serving



\## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350℉. Spray an 8- or 9-inch square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl with a hand mixer, combine the cream cheese, mayonnaise, garlic powder, salt, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, and cayenne (if using). Beat on medium speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula, then fold in the green onion, cheddar, and pepper jack, mixing until combined.
3. Spread the cream cheese mixture into the prepared dish. Bake until the dip is heated through and just starting to bubble at the edges, about 15 minutes.
4. Place the pepper jelly in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave until loose and pourable, about 40 seconds. Pour over the warm dip and spread into an even layer. Serve warm with crackers or vegetables.
